# Voltaire

Voltaire app is an Express backend API for an educational platform
I developed to learn basic back-end stuff.

did:

- CRUD functionality on 2 database models 
- used MongoDB and mongoose for database & handling it 
- register and login functionality
- search functionality for 1 model
- authentication (protecting routes)

to be done:
- front-end consuming API (set up in a different project)
