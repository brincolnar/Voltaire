# Voltaire

Voltaire app is an Express application simulating an educational platform
I developed to learn basic back-end stuff.

Things I did:

- CRUD functionality on 2 database models 
- used MongoDB and mongoose for database & handling it 
- register and login functionality
- search functionality for 1 model

To be done:

- authentication (protecting routes)
